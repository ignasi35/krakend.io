KrakenD is an **API Gateway** builder and proxy generator that sits between the client and all the source servers, adding a new layer that removes all the complexity to the clients, providing them only the information that the UI needs. KrakenD acts as an **aggregator** of many sources into single endpoints and allows you to group, wrap, transform and shrink responses. Additionally it supports a myriad of middelwares and plugins that allow you to extend the functionality, such as adding Oauth authorization or security layers (SSL, certificates, HTTP Strict Transport Security, Clickjacking protection, HTTP Public Key Pinning, MIME-sniffing prevention, XSS protection).
